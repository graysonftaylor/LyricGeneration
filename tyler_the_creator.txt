[Spoken Word: Jerrod Carmichael]
Exactly what you run from, you end up chasing. Like, you can't avoid, but just chasing it and just like trying. Giving it everything that you can. There's always an obstacle-






[Intro]
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me




[Verse 1]
Secrets
Oh, you spin my head around (Oh, you spin my head around)
I been lookin' for it (For it, for it)
I been runnin' out of spells
To make you love me
Secrets
Keep it up
To make you love me (Ah)
Wade in your water (Wade in your water)
Your waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide (I'll be fine)
I found peace in drownin'




[Chorus]
Runnin' out of time, runnin out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me




[Bridge]
Livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty, fuck
Are you livin' in pretend?
Are you–




[Verse 2]
So
Take your mask off
I need her out the picture (Wade in your water)
Take your mask off (Yeah)
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you
Don't save, don't save, don't save
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay
Been runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they working their all, another track out the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin'
Out of time




[Outro]
Of time, of time
Runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta time
Time
Yeah






[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are




[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)




[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together




[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote




[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand






[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down (Yeah)
No, don't shoot me down (Okay)
No, don't shoot me down




[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
We show 'em no respect




[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right, yeah
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Turn me up a little bit)




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down




[Verse 1]
Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fuckin' mind up, I am sick of waitin' patiently
How come you're the best to me? I know you're the worst for me
Boy, you're sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies got me on the fencies
Whole squad in Ginza, travel bag by Balenci'
Big dawg hittin' big wheelies on the six speed




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down




[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why these other niggas lame to us
'Cause all these other niggas lame as fuck
They show 'em no respect




[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)
(Look)
No, don't shoot me down




[Verse 2]
Oh, you passive-aggressive? Oh, you fakin' you're mad?
(You started with a mere hello)
Oh, you wanna go home? Cool, you better call you a cab
I ain't takin' you home, yeah, I'm brushin' you off
'Cause this parka is Comme, you're my favorite garçon
Don't leave, stay right here, yeah, I want you right near
(You started with a mere hello)
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if you 'round a god around this time next year




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down (Fucked up)
No, don't shoot me down
No, don't shoot me down




[Chorus]
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
(You started with a mere hello)
You so motherfuckin' dangerous
You got me by my neck (A boy is a gun)
That's why I start to think it's lame as fuck
(Well, I'm here for you)




[Post-Chorus]
(You started with a mere hello)
When the time's right (Yeah)
When the time's right, baby
When the time's right (A boy is a gun)




[Refrain]
No, don't shoot me down




[Bridge]
(You started with a mere hello)
You're a gun 'cause I like you on my side at all times
You keep me safe (No, don't shoot me down)
(You started with a mere hello)
Wait, wait, depending on, you know (All the time)
You could be dangerous to me (Time, time)
Or anyone else




[Verse 3]
Look, they be bringin' us up
(You started with a mere hello)
Yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout, I see you as a 10
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me




[Outro]
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
No, don't shoot me down
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
(Puppet, oh)
You control me (Control me)
I'm your puppet (Puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me (Puppet)




[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...
...on a...
First, light the weed
First...
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
(Oh, Lord)




[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Breathe on a song

[Part I]




[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor




[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?




[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch




[Verse 2]
Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck




[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?




[Interlude]
Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch
Yeah




[Part II]




[Intro: slowthai]
I see the light
Now didn't I tell you motherfuckers
Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light




[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)




[Chorus: slowthai]
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light




[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...




[Outro: slowthai & Jerrod Carmichael]
Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it






[Part I: GONE, GONE]




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)




[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone




[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me




[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone




[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life




[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone




[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)




[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul




[Part II: THANK YOU]




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again




[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again




[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Again, again
Again, again
(Got my eye)






[Verse 1]
See, um, heavy feelings for you, yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I would speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I’ll just chuck the peace up
I ain't tryna keep up, because




[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this just might be better for us, you know?




[Bridge]
('Cause I don't love like I used to)
Where did time go, I need location
('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?




[Verse 2]
But now, movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)




[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore
But this just might be better for us, you kn-






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & Al Green]
Dream
Just dream
Long ago, long ago, long ago
Dream
Just dream




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? I've got to kno–
Know
If we can still see each other
Shake your hand, say hi
Long ago, long ago, long ago




[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I can't stop you, I can't rock too
I've been back there and I can not die too
But I've got to know




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? Can we be– (Can we be friends?)
Are we still friends? Can we be friends? (Yeah)
Are we still friends?




[Instrumental Interlude]




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
I said, are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends)




[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator & Pharrell Williams]
Don't get green skin (Green skin), keep contact (Keep contact)
Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (Later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend




[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Friends)
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh woah




[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Can't say goodbye (Yeah, ah, ah)
Can't say goodbye, goodbye (Woo)






[Instrumental]






[Verse 1: Santigold]
Snow is falling, it's on the ground
First delayed but it's cancelled now
Late to the train broke myself off
Am I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?
Taking the streets, I'm moving slow
Sure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?
I just wanna get there before you go
I hope I'm getting closer
I hope I'm getting closer


[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home


[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty & Tyler, the Creator]
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there before you know it
Going fast as I can
But the traffic is bad
And my rental is slow
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home
You on my team, I can't be alone
You hear that ring, I pick up the phone
Call, a plane, a walk, a train
No matter which way baby, I'm coming home
Wish that I could press fast forward
To the part where I get there
Seeing all the lights on


[Chorus: Santigold]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home


[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Bar is low, texts slow
No goodbyes, no xo
My flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Hurry cause the plan's urgent
I'm trying to get home like the man's version
Emergency until I see you
And then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon
But let me take your bow off
Wooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off
You my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door
It's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Yeah, leave the lights on






[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
It's gettin' cold, chocolate
Too warm, chocolate
It's too hot (Hot), chocolate


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Leche for my (Woo!) damn self
Hot chocolate
You can use water
Hot chocolate
I prefer milk if it's 2%
Marshmallows on top and some extra whip
You can even use cinnamon, cinnamon on top
Hot chocolate


[Verse 2: Jerry Paper]
By the fire, I sip hot cocoa tonight
It makes me feel all right
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)
Jigsaw puzzle with my buddies
Tonight is our big night
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
Cold that's my favorite, cold that's my favorite time
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime






[Verse 1]
That's a goal
Could you please tell me what you know about skippin' 24, 25
'Cause your mom was at her 9-to-5
Still stacking up the dough
I was wrapping gifts age six with the paper bandanas
Mom was always honest, I ain't never had a Santa Claus
She was my amigo like my buddies from Atlanta
We was hopin' for a signal, too afraid to change the channel, yo


[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
Run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
I run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that


[Verse 2]
That's a big step, snow boots
But it's hot in herre, '02
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Quick, fast, big Max with the big bag, I throw 'em
You stay up, get cake up
For new gifts I take 'em
You wake up like big mad (Where's my gifts?)
Roof to roof, I jump, I jump, I take, I take
It feels the void, I want, I want (More)
Way that I sneak in
I'm about as low as self-esteem when I creep in (Boy)
Don't make noise, my feet thin
I'm looking for the paper, same color my green skin
Toys what is on the list
When it comes to this, I'm too legit
Tell all them kids that he be the Grinch
When they ask who has type of heart to do this


[Chorus]
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
It's me






[Ryan Beatty]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
When the gloves come off, I sleep
That's when the cold begins to creep (Creep in)
I can't feel my hands
Ahh


[Tyler, the Creator]
Boom, boom, ba-boom
Go down
Back to one (Two)
Yeah






[Instrumental]






[Intro]
Bitch, fuck! (Uh, uh, fuck)
You have a question?


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
How many cars can I buy 'til I run outta drive?
How much drive can I have until I run outta road?
How much road can they pave until I run outta land?
How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?
Niggas go with the motions and all the plans
See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows, and posies
Fallin' outta my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up, then I'm TNT, I'm gone


[Bridge: Rex Orange County]
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Shout out to the girls that I led on
For occasional head and always keepin' my bed warm
And tryin' their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keepin' me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be until them Black lives matter?
Niggas click-clack splatter, (Pew) pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm drivin' is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one (Nah)
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if them ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in


[Outro: Rex Orange County]
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
Don't come back
Don't come back
Ayy, don't come back
Don't come back
No, no






[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt (Skrrt!)
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga


[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Tyler the Creator]
I ride to California (Yeah)
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me (ayy, yeah)
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga (Stunt on these niggas!)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too (What the fuck?)
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man
It feels like I'm winning (I'm winnin', nigga)
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me (Oh, ooh)
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
(Ohh, ohh!)


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk


[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Ah, shit!


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it






[Tyler, The Creator]
Sometimes, I sit in my room and think about us


[Shane Powers]
"It's Golf Radio, you're on the air with Shane Powers
Taking requests... Uh, What’s uh, pick that one... What's uh... What's your name? Hello? Um, okay, well, since you want to be Mr. Fucking-Secret-Agent, what song you wanna hear?"


[Wyatt Navarro]
The one about me






[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up


[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes


[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'Fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me", what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Uugh!


[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)


[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?






[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?


[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frío
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way-way, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck






[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Shit


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues
Like how I ain't notice that? (How I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (Skrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
'Cause y'all throw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga


[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga


[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Tyler, the Creator]
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole


[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes
Haha






[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah


[Bridge: Estelle & Tyler, the Creator]
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go


[Chorus: Estelle]
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matter






[Intro: Rex Orange County & Corinne Bailey Rae]
When you're having fun, fun
Time flies, time flies, time flies
When you're having fun (time flies)
Out the window (it goes, goes, goes)


[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Ah


[Verse 1: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Boredom got a new best friend
(Boredom, boredom, best friend)
'Cause boredom got a new best friend (oh, oh, oh)
Boredom got a new best friend
Na-na-na, na-na-na, oh-na-na-na
Oh, oh, oh


[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
(Find some time, oh)


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all-day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."


[Chorus: Rex Orange County & Anna of the North]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh)


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
(Desperate, using, texting, amusing)
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven’t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)


[Chorus: Rex Orange County, Anna of the North and Tyler, the Creator]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something(Tick Tock)
(Ti-Ti-Tick Tock)
(Oh)


[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator & Anna of the North]
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Tick tock
Boredom got a new best friend
'Cause boredom got a new best friend
Tick tock


[Outro: Rex Orange County]
Find some time, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time


[Shane Powers]
"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-"






[Intro: Shane Powers]
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun


[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time


[Verse 1]
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!
You bitch ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place


[Chorus]
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time


[Verse 2]
Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow


[Bridge]
(Hey)
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock


[Verse 3]
Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line will have 'em like "Whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick-tock)
(And that's a fact boy!)
And I just handle all my business like a chessboard
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And at them Golf boys?
That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from abroad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)


[Verse 4]
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
Yeah right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)


[Outro]
Listen, man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Bitch
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Fuck, hello






[Part I: 911]


[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me)
(Call me) How you doin'?
(Call me) My name is Lonely, nice to meet you
Here's my number
You can reach me, woo!


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me)
911, call me some time
(You should call me)
911, call me some time
911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold-out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911


[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line


[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Anna of the North]
Call me
911, call me some time
You should call me
911, call me some time
911, (you should call me, oh)
911, (you should call me)


[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine


[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...


[Part II: Mr. Lonely]


[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely


[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911


[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!






[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mula!


[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Like Adam in the Garden of Eden
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my seed
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' seeds like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler named the song "Flower"
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Droppin' seeds on these niggas, they can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)
I'm droppin' seeds on these bitches for the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden, flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker, Weezy Baby the boy, yugh!






[Intro]
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, November...


[Chorus]
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup


[Verse 1]
What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if "Who Dat Boy" is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer '06, I remember the... (horn)
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!


[Chorus]
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup


[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin, Taco, Kilo Kish, Christian Clancy, Syd, Lionel, Vince Staples, Julian Conesugra]
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever...
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November


[Bridge]
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
"My November is right now"


[Verse 2]
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback


[Outro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
[beep]






[Intro]
Da na na na na, da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind (How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends


[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life (How ya feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life


[Verse 1]
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner, got the heat, like wait
Got the shit, it's all up on that hip
I'll use it on myself on the day you dip
Got that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me
Baby doll, I hope you agree
Because you light my


[Chorus]
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around


[Verse 2]
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
When I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't (how ya feel?)
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me


[Bridge]
Ooooh
(Please don't save me, yeah)
How ya feel?
(Rose tinted cheeks)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?


[Outro]
We didn't get your message, either because you were not speaking or because of a bad connection
Fuck






[Instrumental]






[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, excuse me mister, but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album "Cherry Bomb" because "Greatest Hits" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; "Who's in charge of this Golf shit?"
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick."
It's young T


[Bridge]
I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life


[Outro]
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)






[Intro: Bunny Sigler]
"Yeah!"
"You feel alright?"
"Yeah!"


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T nuts, surprised his thoughts isn't chafing
And fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew, them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word "faggot" with "book"
And all them "books" is pissed off and had they page in a bunch
Fucking attitude switched just like a "book" when it struts
But I'm a fraud, I pray to God when the six triple "book" bashing
While me and my favorite author's lips tickle
Peter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fucking kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded, so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kidding, keep the Tommy on me; bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seemed off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'Preme off
Should've bought some stock in it (Yo, it's fucked up, I get it, put a sock in it)
Not Golf when the little homies don't—wait, let's weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, and bought some attention
Ain't give none to Hopsin, and dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad? It's the slave in me
It's facts, boy, I'm back like Rosa Parks's least favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T
While y'all niggas watching the throne, the throne be watching me


[Interlude: Shane Powers, Tyler, The Creator, Bunny Sigler]
"If you fuck this up... There are so many fucking kids right now, listening to this guy."
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")
"Get those wings flapping, motherfucker! 'Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly."
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigga, nigga on the wall
Rap bars, jail bars, die or shoot a basketball
Tyler, the dark skin arrested in Austin
Cops know who I was cause their kids said the show was awesome
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")
"Tyler, Tyler, I swear to—I swear to fuck! If you fucking... Do not fuck this up! You have the whole world in your fucking hands."
("Yeah!"—"You feel alright?"—"Yeah!")


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
How many leaders in the house?
Well can somebody bring the mirrors out? I'm getting lonely
Likes and apologies and snaps make it obvious
That everybody on this fucking planet lacking confidence
How many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)
Well can somebody bring the camera out so I can film me?
T a great director, niggas' vision must be blurry
Boy, I get them epic shots like jaywalking in Missouri
Wait, how many leaders in the house?
Well can somebody bring my album out so I can hear one?
Pour me a drink, shit, I don't know what to think
Cause all these niggas leaning like they Forest Whitaker's blink
Wait, how many leaders in the house?
See why nobody got they hands up? See, that's the issue






[Verse 1]
Fly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when? Uh
On a scale of nine to ten
You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind, uh
Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, motherfucker, I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga, you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fucking embarrass you
Now sit your ass down, you doing three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up


[Break]


[Verse 2]
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you niggas
I'm saying (I'm saying I'm dead to you niggas)
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fucking pilot, your role is to be the stewardess
I'm the fucking bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it
The boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it
If anything happens, it's one door
If I see a building, motherfucker, we're done for
I'ma hit a couple of 'em up, this is parkour
Better call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Till there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore
I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Till there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash
(I don't wanna crash)


[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator, Syd]
I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(And it's okay if I fall, I just wanna fly)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(The wind's getting high, I don't wanna crash)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
(And it's okay if I fall, I just wanna fly)
It's kinda weird
(The wind is getting high)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, look (Say what?)
(Oh, yeah, yeah)


[Outro]
I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be with no alphabet
Dictating where to stand at
You can buy a car, you can buy many things
You can buy happiness, but you can't buy wings
You can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic
To stay cloud level
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach (Fucked up)
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
It's just crazy how you can have everything in the world, but
You in first class but you feel like coach, damn
That's why I'm in first class, but I feel like coach


[Outro]
I don't wanna—






[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
Fuck you running for nigga?
Aye nigga, come here nigga
Let me try that hat on
I told you come over here stupid bitch
Come over here with that weak ass hat


[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out
In the car called life take the lame route
Going nowhere fast but you think that you not
Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out
In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop
At his drop top, took another lame out
Oh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?
Well I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga
Cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas
And make sure that your mama cry the pain out
Now that gang is out to get you
But you stuck in the same house
Nigga never came out, wow
It's a shame how you got sucked in that life
But hey man at least you got a name now
They say you a "real nigga" cause you kill niggas
Nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas
Banana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out
For they approval boy, you can't even hang out
That light you hit, it was the light I held
That's why you never ever see me with my chains out
I don't need to, truth they don't feed you
Lies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you
They got a homie called Karma he gon meet you
Better look the other way if he ever see you
And run as fast as you can, nigga


[Outro: Chaz Bundick and ScHoolboy Q]
That's the shit I be talkin' bout, though
We ain't try'na hear that shit, my nigga
Cuz, stay preachy cuz
Like nigga come on homie
I don't wanna hear that shit, preachy shit my nigga
Yeah, we all black, who give a fuck, cuz?
I don't give a fuck, nigga
Whatchu mean?






[Instrumental Intro]


[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Find your wings (You're supposed to fly)
Find your wings (Find your wings)



[Verse 1: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'?
Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot
You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin'
The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta



[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Find your wings (Fly)
Find your wings (Find your wings)
(My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy)


[Verse 2: Kali Uchis]
We can go down to the rainbows
Don't let your high keep your brain low
You're a bird
You're supposed to fly away
The way you stand there
Don't let your wings go to waste (Go to waste)
The sky is your home, be free
Be free






[Intro]
I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know what it mean
It means something


[Verse 1]
Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out your flowers don't smell that good?
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else nose to win
Look, I am a God, nobody prays to the sight of you
All y'all niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
I wear pink, they can see me
Nigga, you don’t create, you just repeat
Nigga, you don’t got drive, you just beep beep
Beep beep, talk shit from the backseat


[Pre-Chorus]
Come and light my fire
I'll blow your fucking face off
Nigga, I'm the goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it


[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tie the knot (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kick the chair (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Float in the air (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's cherry bomb


[Verse 2]
You motherfuckers want war? Then come get it
You motherfuckers don't really want it
You motherfuckers want war and I want more
Nigga, fuck you and everything that you come for
You motherfuckers wanna blow?
Pow, pow-pow, pow-pow
Then let’s take ‘em to the gun store
I don't got enough time, fuck your Rolex, nigga
Don’t compare him to mine, ‘cause I don’t know that, nigga


[Pre-Chorus]
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fucking face off
Nigga, I'm the goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it


[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tie the knot (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kick the chair (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Float in the air (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"GOLF 191, Okaga! Playing only classic hits!"






[Verse 1]
I don't want you thinking I love you 'cause I stay
Girl I really like you and happy we got laid
I think about your windows like four times in a day
I'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved
Kissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking
The holy grail of your body, when you be pissin'
This is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen
I come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa
You hoping I'm joking, but first


[Hook]
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load


[Verse 2]
Your pussy tighter than door hinges
I munch you like sandwiches
But not any more 'cause I'm on tour, so
Look: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick
I go hard, shit, I might need ice pack on my wrist
Fucking, I'm pumping, you know it's coming
Bust in a couple of seconds, I'm sweating
I leave you slumped in the back of my truck, butt naked
Suck it out of me, I leave you with nuttin', get it?
This is what you wanted, this is what you came for


[Hook]
I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera, nine months later with a Tyler baby face
But that won't happen 'til I blow my load


[Interlude: Syd & Tyler]
There's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries (You blow me away)
With your cherry (Cherry Bomb)
Make me feel like 4th of July
(Can't breathe)
Cherry
You light my fireworks
There's something 'bout the way you pick your cherries (You blow me away)
With your cherry bomb


[Outro: Shane Powers]
That was new music from the soundtrack of the upcoming film [honk]
Be caller eight to win tickets to the triple feature at the Moon Theatres tonight
Three back to back to back movies at the Moon Theatres tonight
Be the eighth caller, only on Golf Radio
G-O-L-F, G-O-L-F, it's Golf Radio






[Chorus]
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater


[Verse 1]
About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop
You see my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
Since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
E92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And if I crash I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince
Tiptronic stick or automatic you pick
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is AM
Might get that X6 end, don't follow exit him
Might take a back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on him neck next his precious gems
No AMG, it's M, boy I will eat him Benz
New engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty don't care if you scratching rims again


[Chorus]
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl, I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater


[Bridge]
Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, 'cause you driving me wild
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes it's too much
And you can feel the beat in my heart
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes it's too much


[Verse 2]
I know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers
And shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda
Then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonald's
Boy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm
Cashing so many checks they're calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09
Probably September...
Boy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves
Skate park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
'Cause I killed the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in (beep)
Give it 'til he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it


[Verse 3]
Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)


[Skit]
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
'Cause it's windy!
But I love it when your hair...


[Verse 4]
Blows, when it blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches


[Interlude]
You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows
(It blows me away)
I know we'll have a good time
You just gotta stop being scared
Just roll
Just come and roll with me
It's all good


[Skit]
Yeah, man, what's good man, you good? I've been chilling, man. I've been doing some push-ups and shit
For real?

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I looked in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree"
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know, they got thirty seconds; Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy, it's Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o


[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Can't a nigga get some fucking chaos in hurr?
I'm the truth and the dare
And you can get your ass beat just like the kick and the snare
ScHoolboy's my niggy, you know I'm good in the 50s
That boy not that bad, eh, it's no Biggie
It's the G-O, and the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We blackout, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy man
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to a Dodger
Solve 'em (Oh no!) You can't bitch, I'm a problem
And you'll get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo
Brent Lowe, mind motherfuckin' been gone
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow


[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Don't get offended, love being darkskinned-ed
23 with a crib, and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis
Is that diamonds on your neck? Stay the fuck out my business
See, that's that Cherry Bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron
Motors Flog Gnaw, Vans on, fuck your Jordans
Went from throwing up to throwing carnivals
Boy, I'm a sicko, Flaco nigga, but kinda macho
Boy, I got some vatos and shout out to ScHooly, he kinda loco
Pack a de la pistol, we splitting nachos, then for that cheese
Boy, he was using some shells just like a taco, so grab your goggles
Nigga, Taco Tuesday, you don't want none of that
Have you heard of Fairfax? Boy, we was running that
Nigga took the store from us, yeah, fuck all of that
(Man, he really took the store)


Crack a cracker with a barrel, uh (yeah)
Gang bang tattoos, this ain't a Louis rag (rag)
Orange Paisley got me crip crazy (uh, sup cuz?)
Pants heavy, sag to the left with the belt strapped
No face mask, nigga, just toe tags
Still, the blunts getting passed, yeah
Ain't worried 'bout no niggas (nigga)
I don't grieve over suckers (sucker)
Gunpowder on my knuckles (knuckle)
Call the ambulances (ambulances)
I'm from the era of crip walking
You was clown-dancing, you wanna be me, huh?
Cuz is wack in his raps and what he rap, he ain't done
It's Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussyboy, you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel, you want to smoke that kill
Well, who am I?


Part 2 - SPECIAL (Hidden track, physical only)


[Intro]
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker
Anything that'll piss you muthafuckas off
I don't even smoke and I'm a level above of y'all
Bitch, you couldn't reach me with a ladder and a calling card


[Hook]
I'm special, nigga
Who the fuck are you?!
I'm special, nigga


[Verse]
They used to tell me to calm down, said I have a problem
Now I'm runnin' shit, that's why you never see me wearin' joggers
Lead by example, how?
All y'all is my son and I ain't never had a fuckin' father
Boy, I'ma bring the noise
I got my own beat and we all got drums
What these weapons about? We're just flexin' about
You on your grind but who the one that got the wep at their house?
Bitch, I do this on purpose, you niggas don't got a purpose
This nigga call me a clown, nigga I own the circus
Stack is sittin' in my pocket folded like a papaya
You know I golf bitch like I been sleepin' with Tiger
Woody woody, my mob, mob is goodie we Oddkast
We O-K-K-K just like the clan hoodie
Golf shit packet, rip it out the fuckin' package
In that all pink fit lookin' like a fuckin' faggot
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, nigga!?
I'm a bad case of I don't even know
I gotta to tear the shit out of this goddamn house
I think that I'mma blow my muthafuckin' brains out
Tyler, take a chill pill, nigga






Part 1 - FUCKING YOUNG


[Intro]
Day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing, whatever look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion begin
'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't


[Pre-Chorus]
There go the policeman (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man, I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love


[Verse 1]
A six-year (Difference)
Is a ten year (Sentence)
And with the (Pigment) on my skin
I don't want to be another (Statistic)
You bring me (Joy, joy, joy, joy)
And you fill a void that was once missing
And (I can say I'm in love)


[Pre-Chorus]
There go the police man (Knocking at my door)
Do I leave out the back and (Grab my wallet and coat)
Or do I answer real confused like ("I don't know")
Now me and she held hands (And we danced, nothing more)
She kissed my hand a couple times, (FaceTime when we're bored)
There's nobody at the door, (Man I'm so paranoid)
Fuck, 'cause


[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
'Cause girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (for me)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love


[Verse 2]
When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb,you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck


[Outro]
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young


Part 2 - PERFECT


[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)


[Verse 1: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me


[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah


[Outro]
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I bloom)
I rock (I glow)






Part I


[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy, I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga


[Pre-Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not important
I'm focused (Two, three, four)
Bring in the horns


[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, God damn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nig​ger
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
Well, when we ate, it was the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!


[Bridge: Kanye West]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me? (Two, three, four)
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas (Two, three, four)
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' (Two, three, four)
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?" Yeah, my nigga
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters, "Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money (Two, three, four)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny (Two, three, four)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (Woo) (Two, three, four)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (Skrrrrt)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level (Two, three, four)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God (Two, three, four)
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"


[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy, I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room, damn
